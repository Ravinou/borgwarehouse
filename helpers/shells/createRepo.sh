# Shell created by Raven for BorgWarehouse.
# This shell takes 3 arguments : [reponame] X [SSH pub key] X [quota]
# Main steps are :
# - check if args are present
# - check the ssh pub key format
# - check if borgbackup package is install
# - generate a random username, check if it exists in /etc/passwd
# - add the user (with random name), group, shell and home
# - create a pool which is the folder where all the repositories for a user are located (only one by user for borgwarehouse usage)
# - create the authorized_keys
# - add the SSH public key in the authorized_keys with borg restriction for repository and storage quota.
# This simple method prevents the user from connecting to the server with a shell in SSH.
# He can only use the borg command. Moreover, he will not be able to leave his repository or create a new one.
# It is similar to a jail and that is the goal.

# Exit when any command fails
set -e
